      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        "Hi there! I'm a Front-end Wizard 🧙‍♂️ with 3+ years of mad skills in
        making websites look cool and work like a charm, especially for online
        shops using shopify, magento and woocommerce and super-fast web apps
        using Vue.js and React." 😎🚀
      </p>
      <p>
        "I snagged my bachelor's degree at Monash University down under in
        Melbourne, Australia – the land of cute koalas and kangaroos! While I
        was there, I also kickstarted my career in eCommerce development, got
        the lowdown on student mindfulness, and picked up the nifty skills to
        meet customers' web needs." 🦘🐨🎓
      </p>
      <p>
        "My wanderlust led me to the enchanting city of Istanbul, Turkey, where
        I joined forces with PT. Solutions – the cool cats in the world of
        logistics software. I teamed up with fellow developers to whip up some
        slick Vue apps that made logistics feel like a breeze!" 🌍💼🚀
      </p>
      <p>
        "Finally, after dreaming about it since 2006, I'm living the California
        dream in the good ol' USA! I used to see this place in Hollywood flicks
        and on social media, and now I'm soaking it all in. I'm stoked about
        kick starting my career here and making a real impact in this world with
        my skills!" 🌴💫
